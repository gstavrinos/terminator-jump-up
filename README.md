# terminator-jump-up
A terminator plugin that allows you to scroll back to the start of the last command's output.

To install it, simply copy the jump.py file to ~/.config/terminator/plugins and then enable it through the preferences menu. If you don't have a plugins directory under terminator, create one first!
